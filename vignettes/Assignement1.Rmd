# Introduction
This is the vignette detailing the requirements for assignment 1.

# Chapter 1
This chapter deals with basic metrics between multivariable data including sample means, sample variances, and covariances.

## Problem 1.1
In this problem we were asked to determine the sample means, sample variances, and covariance between two vectors of length 7. The vectors used and metrics calculated are provided below.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
x1 <- c(3,4,2,6,8,2,5)
x2 <- c(5,5.5,4,7,10,5,7.5)
mean_var_cov(x1,x2)
```
